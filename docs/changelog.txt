2.1.2
-----------------
- Still TODO: Reorganizar el look_message (también conocido como la
  torre de babel).

- Usar el módulo "email" para decodificación internacional
  (decode_header, parseaddr, parsedate, formatdate, make_msgid, etc).
-----------------

- Use list comprensions where (and only where) it improves clearness of
  the code.

2.1.1
- German translation added

- Updated doc to new bogofilter

2.1.0
- Two small fixes for the config file parser.

- Started using some Python 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3 features 
  (including the object model, boolean type and other bits)
- Printed text now wraps accordingly with the terminal width
  or 80 if it can't determine the terminal width (using the
  'tput cols' command at start).
- Using the 'official' timeout support in the socket module 
  instead of Timothy O'Malley (now obsolete, but great anyway)
  timeoutsocket module.

- Fixed a lot of bugs in IMAP. Now this protocol doesn't need to
  reconect to failed servers because all message deletions are
  synchronous.

- Fixed some locking issues with the threads (this should fix the "some
  servers seem to hang until the timeout expires" bug).

- TODO: ¡Prefiltros, prefiltros y prefiltros! No entiendo como no se me
  ha ocurrido antes esta idea...


2.0.1 
- Some minor fixes

2.0
- Spanish documentation updated

2.0-rc3
- More fixes.
- More robust email address parsing (take_address and takefromm are
  dead, long live to the rfc822 module!)


2.0-rc2
- Fixed a tempfile bug.

2.0-rc1
- Fixed the crazy-DNS problem that was halting the downloads of some
  users (it was a stupid little curious error). The fix should also speedup
  Animail a little for all users.
- Implemented lockfiles so a user can't exec more than one instance of
  Animail at a time.
  
2.0-pre19
- Ignore the WU-IMAPD 'DONTDELETETHISMESSAGE' type messages.
- Fix for a posibble misconfiguration on animailrc.
- Added the option 'SMTPSpamCodes' to the config file that allows you to
  set a list of SMTP Errors that will cause the offending message to be
  deleted instead of being left undeleted. This is useful to use with
  SMTP servers anti-spam features.

2.0-pre18
- Fixes and a new parameter for 'savepostfilteredemails': Stdout (save
  only the stdout output of the program, never the stderr).

- Documentation updates.

2.0-pre17 
- Fixes

2.0-pre16
- Fixes.

2.0-pre15
- Bug fixes.

2.0-pre14
- Added patch by Jose Luis Triviño <trivino@lcc.uma.es> that adds the 'ignore'
  option to the NotInAcceptFile config command.

2.0-pre13
- Now Animail will use a socket timeout of 60 seconds if no timeout is specified. Use Timeout: 0 to disable
  using a timeout on sockets.
- Documentation and -h help fixes.

2.0-pre12
- Use Psyco to compile some methods, when available (can improve the
  compiling of regular expressions lists by about 200%!)

2.0-pre11
- Bug fixes

2.0-pre10
- The 'Now I can filter everything' release
- Added hooks to exec any program as a filter once the message is
  downloaded and just before delivering it (like spamassassin,
  bogofilter, etc...).
- Fixes and improvements, specially on configfile.py
  
  Now that I've added a new big feature in a pre10 version I should burn on 
  hell fixing bugs forever.
- Updated documentation

2.0-pre9
- Guess what: Fixes

2.0-pre8
- Fixes

2.0-pre7
- Fixes

2.0-pre6
- For popular request, re-implemented the option to reconnect to failed
  servers to delete already downloaded messages
- Fixed a bug with IMAP4
- Performance improvements on the config file parser
  
2.0-pre5
- Fixed the evil 'IndexError' bug
- Minor tweaks

2.0-pre4
- Makefile work.

2.0-pre3
- Better handling of broken messages with IMAP4.
- i18n updates.

2.0-pre2
- Little fix for --version 
- More work on the spanish documentacion
- Indentation (finally!) follows the Python coding standarts (mostly ;)
  so other Python programmers contributing to Animail will (hopefully)
  be no more annoyed with my braindead ex-style of indenting code.

2.0-pre1
- Update to es.po
- Small changes an fixes
- Half-updated spanish documentation
- INSTALL file with FreeBSD > 4.5 note
- Makefile changes for xBSD

1.1.32
- New manual page
- Bugfixes
- -O (--only-from=) option to select a restricted number of servers to
  download mails from on this run.

1.1.31
- Made unhandled exceptions (bug reports) go also to the syslog if 
  configured.
- Update the animailrc example file

1.1.30
- Bugfixes
- Fixed the help shown with --help
- New config option: OnlyOneReply (mades Animail only send a reply to
  the first message from an address not in accept or in the filter
  file).
