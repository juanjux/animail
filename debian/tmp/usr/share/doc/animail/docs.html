	with this).

    <P><BR>


    <H2><A name="2:Filtrado"></A>2. The filtering system</H2>
    The filtering system relies on three elements:<BR>
     

    <OL>
      <LI>The accept file

      <LI>The deny file

      <LI>The postergated messages
    </OL>
    The accept file is (like the deny file) a file in which each line is a regular
    expression (man regexp). If the header of the message currently being downloaded
    match one of those regular expressions, the message is automatically accepted,
    without having to check the deny file. Those expressions Those regular expressions
    will usually be the ones matching the messages from out friends, work partnerts,
    mailing list we're subscribed to, etc. 

    <P>The path to the accept file is specified in the animailrc file with:<BR>
     AcceptFile: /path/to/acceptfile

    <P>Just including the above command in the animailrc activates his use.

    <P>The deny file has the same format that the accept file, but insted of making the
    messages matching one of their regular expressions to be accepted has the reverse
    effect: They are deleted from the server without even downloading his body. The
    regular expressions we write in this file will usually match the email addresses of
    known spammers. Of course, using regular expression syntax we can match anything
    contained in the header, not only the 'From' address but also the number of people in
    the Cc: field and almost any other thing we can think of (regular expressions are
    extremelly powerfull).

    <P>The path to the deny file is specified in the animailrc file with:<BR>
     Filterfile: /path/to/filterfile

    <P>Just including the above command in the animailrc activated his use.

    <P>So depending of we using one, both or none of the above files we're going to have
    one or other filtering system. If we only define the deny file (Animail only allowed
    this until version 1.1.28) we are going to be using a 'black list' scheme. This
    scheme worked very well in 1998 when Animail started to be developed, because there
    weren't soo many spammers and most of the spam come from a few addresses.
    Unfortunately nowadays this filtering system is not enough because there are a lot of
    spammers and they change frecuently his address. A solution to this oculd be to try
    some very generic regular expressions to filter subsentences like 'lot of money' o
    'life for ever' in the subject, but unfortunately this can result in legitimate email
    being deleted (for example, a friend sending us an email with the subject "I found
    work for you which can make you earn lots of money".

    <P>Trying to a find a solution for this, Animail (version 1.1.28 and up) allows
    another two filtering systems (inspired by the idea the software <A href=
    "http://tmda.sf.net">TMDA</A> is using but applied to a different level. TMDA is
    distributed with a BSD license, but Animail doesn't share any code with it.):<BR>


    <OL>
      <LI>To deny anything not in the accept file.

      <LI>To put messages not in the accept file or in the filter file in a 'postergated'
      state and send a polite message back asking for a confirmation
    </OL>

    <P>The first option is very aggresive, but can be interesting for people that only
    want to receive email from limited sources (like mailing list and some friends). To
    use this option besides having specified the path to the accept file we need to add
    to the global section of the animailrc:<BR>
     NotInAcceptFile: Delete

    <P>The second option, undoubtedly more usefull for most people, is that each time we
    receive and email from a source not in the accept or deny file that message is put
    'on hold' in the animailDelayed directory under the .animail directory of out home
    dir, and a polite reply is sent specifiying why is message has not been delivered yet
    (anti spam measures) and asking to reply to that autoreply so his address is added to
    the accept file. When Animail receive that reply all the messages 'on hold' are
    delivered, and the original address is added to the accept file (we can configure
    Animail not to add automatically the address, see the <A href="#32:Globales">global
    options reference</A>.)

    <P>Is important to note that is we're using this filtering system we've to add the
    different mailing list address we're subscribed to the accept file, and some other
    strings matching some automatically generated messages we want to receive (like
    "MAILER-DAEMON", "subscri", etc).

    <P>Anyway when the operation summary is shown, we can see what email address have
    been put on hold and looking for some days those address we can figure what strings
    to put on the accept file (we can manually read the messages put on hold opening the
    mbox files under .animail/animailDelayed with our favourite mail reader.)

    <H3><B><A name="21:OtrosFiltros"></A>2.1 Combining Animail with other
    filters (SpamAssassin, procmail, etc)</B></H3><BR>

    <p> As the tittle of this section suggests, Animail can be used with
    other external filters to combine his filtering skills with the ones
    already on Animail. Those filters (you can specify any number of
    them) will be called just after downloading a message and just
    before delivering it; depending of the return value of some output
    of that filter the message will be delivered, ignored, or copied to
    a log mailbox (so you can see if those filters are not deleting
    important mail). All the commands discussed on the examples of this
    subsection are detailed on the <a href="#33:PostFiltros">&lt;PostFilter&gt; command block
    reference</a>.
    
    <p>
    Doing it is very easy: You just have to create a new PostFilter
    block and configure in a way suitable for the program you are using.
    You can also add options to copy the filtered messages to a log
    mailbox, to copy the output of the post-filter instead of the
    original message to that mailbox (this is useful for programs which
    output is the original message modified, like <a
    href="http://spamassassin.taint.org/">SpamAssassin</a>). It is
    more easy to see with a few examples:
    <p>
    <b>PostFilter block for <a
    href="http://spamassassin.taint.org/">SpamAssassin</a>:</b><br>
    <code>
    &lt;PostFilter&gt;<br>
    PostFilterName: SpamAssassin<br>
    Path: /usr/bin/spamassassin<br>
    KillerProgramOutput: ^X-Spam-Flag: YES.*$<br>
    SavePostFilteredMails: stdout<br>
    &lt;PostFilter&gt;<br>
    </code>

    <p> The first command, after the tag, tells the name of the filter
    (for the program output). The 'Path' command is the path to the
    filter executable and third is a regular expression that if match
    with the program output will filter the message. The last command
    tells Animail to save the standart output of spamassasin in a special mailbox
    ('spambox'). That's all. Well, not exactly; you also have to put
    this on the global section:

    <p>
    <code>
    PostFilteredMailsMbox: /home/yourhome/spambox<br>
    </code>

    <p>
    This command specifies the spambox to use to save filtered mails.

    <p>
    More examples:

    <p>
    <b>PostFilter block for spamc (SpamAssassin C client):</b><br>
    <code>
    &lt;PostFilter&gt;<br>
    PostFilterName: SpamAssassin-spamc<br>
    Path: /usr/bin/spamc<br>
    KillerReturnValues: 1<bR>
    SavePostFilteredMails: stdout<br>
    &lt;PostFilter&gt;<br>
    </code>

    <p>
    <b>PostFilter block for <a
    href="http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/bogofilter/">Bogofilter</a>:</b><br>
    <code>
    &lt;PostFilter&gt;<br>
    PostFilterName: Bogofilter<br>
    Path: /usr/bin/bogofilter<br>
    KillerReturnValues: 0<br>
    SavePostFilteredMails: no<br>
    &lt;PostFilter&gt;<br>
    </code>

    <p><b>How to add a new postfilter block for other commands:</b>
    The first thing you have to see is if that program read the mails
    from his standart input or are specified as a file to his command
    line, maybe after some parameter. In the first case you don't have
    to specify nothing to Animail; stdin input is the default. In the
    second case, you must write inside the postfilter section:
    <code>InputMessageByStdin: No</code> and in the <code>Options</code>
    command you have to put a '%M' control code where you would usally
    write the path to the message (along with other possible options).
    Now you have to look how the filter reports when a program is spam
    or not; Animail can handle to cases: Where the program returns some
    special return code if the message if spam (like 'Bogofilter'
    returning 0) or if the program output by his standard output or
    standard error some text when it finds a spam message (this is the
    case with SpamAssassin, which outputs X-Spam-Flag: YES). In the
    first case the command to use is <code>KillerReturnValues:</code>,
    which parameter is a comma separated list (that could contain a
    single element) of numeric return codes, and in the second case is
    <code>KillerProgramOutput</code> followed by one regular expression
    that have to match the program output that reports spam. Maybe a
    program can report spam in both ways (like SpamAssassin spamc
    client); in this case you're safe writing both commands on the
    config file (they are not exclusive). Finally you have to decide if
    you want to see the filter output after every run (if there is some
    output, that is) or you want to hide that output (that will still be
    parsed by Animail if <code>KillerProgramOutput</code> is specified).
    This is done with the <code>ShowFilterOutput</code> command that can
    have the values yes/no, defaulting to 'no'.

    <p>
    Finally you have to decide if you want the filtered messages to be
    copied to another mailbox (I call it 'spambox') where you could
    check later for false positives (not spam tagged as spam). This is
    done with the <code>SavePostFilteredMails</code> command that can
    have the values 'yes' for coying the original mail to the spambox,
    no for don't, and 'output' to copy the filter program output instead
    of the original mail (this is useful with filters like SpamAssassin
    that print on his standard output a new version of the email of his
    standard input). If you set this command to anything besides 'no'
    you will also have to set the globa section command
    <code>PostFilteredMailsMBox</code> to a writable path, or Animail
    will issue a warning every time a spam-message is to be copied.

    <H2><B><A name="3:Referencia"></A>3. Animailrc configuration reference</B></H2>

    <P><B>Note:</B> This file must exist in each Animail user home directory under the
    directory .animail/ , there is not a system-wide configuration file.

    <P>This file is composed of one or more server groups and optionally
    postfilter groups and a global group.
    Each server groups defines the options for a specified server and the global option
    group defines... well, the global options. The postfilter groups
    specify the options for using an external programs as a help for the
    filtering system.

    <P>Servers groups are delimited between the starting tag <B>&lt;Server&gt;</B> and
    the ending tag <B>&lt;/Server&gt;</B> , and global the global options groups by
    <B>&lt;Global&gt;</B> and <B>&lt;/Global&gt;</B> , so the general structure for an
    animailrc file could be:

    <P>&lt;Server&gt;

    <P>[Server commands here]

    <P>&lt;/Server&gt;

    <P><BR>


    <P>&lt;Server&gt;

    <P>&lt;Global&gt;

    <P>[Global options here]

    <P>&lt;/Global&gt;<BR>

     File with the body of the message to be sent in the replies to emails not in the
    accept or in the filter file asking the user to a confirmation just replying to this
    message, so his email can be finally delivered and his address added to the accept
    file. If this command is not specified a polite message in several languages
    (currently english, spanish and italian, looking for help with more translations)
    will be used.

    <P><B>15. FileWithConfirmation:<BR>
     <I>Parameter: string (path to file)<BR>
     Default value: None (in this case the default message will be the one that can be
    read in the file general.py of the Animail distribution)</I></B><BR>
     File with the body of the message to be sent in the replies to users confirmations.

    <P><B>17. OnlyOneReply:<BR>
     <I>Parameter: Boolean (yes/no)<BR>
     Default value: No</I></B><BR>
     Animail keeps a list of replied addresses in the file $HOME/.animail/repliedList.dat

    message coming from an address not matching a regular expression in the accept or in
    the filter file (the operation summary will continue to show the postergated
    messages).

    <P>To prevent excesive startup time and memory usage, the list of replied messages
    has a maximum size of 500 entries (older entries will be removed when that sized is

    is to issue a timeout after 60 seconds, use 'Timeout:0' to disable using a timeout on sockets.

    <P><B>19. Mailer:</B><BR>


    <P>[deprecated]<BR>

    <P><B>21. Reconnect:</B><BR>
    <i><b>Parameter: Boolean (yes/no)</b></i><br>
    <i><b>Default value: yes</b></i><br>
    When some server fail (for whatever reason) during the operation, Animail will try
    to reconnect to that server at the end of the session to delete already downloaded
    messages so the next time we try to download messages from that servers you wont have 
    duplicated messages on you mail spool. Enabled by default.

    <p><b>22. WaitBeforeReconnection:</b><br>
    <i><b>Parameter: Numeric (time in seconds)</b></i><br>
    <i><b>Default value: 30</b></i><br>
    Time before reconnecting to a failed server (see the Reconnect option). This time start
    counting in the moment that the server failed. This is necessary because some servers (usually
    POP3 servers) don't allow the clients to do more than one connection at a time, and the
    server needs some time to know that the connection is lost and close that session.

    <p><b>23. PostFilteredMailsMBox:</b><br>
    <I><b>Parameter: String (Path to mailbox file)</B></i><br>
    <i><b>Default value: None</b></i><br>
    This options tell Animail to save the message filtered by the
    post-filters (see the <a href="#21:OtrosFiltros">Using Animail with
    other filters</a> and <a href="#33:PostFiltros">Post-Filter
    options</a> sections) on a mailbox ('spambox') file. For this option
    to be useful you must also set the 'SavePostFilteredMails' option of
    one or more <a href="#33:PostFiltros">&lt;PostFilter&gt; command
    blocks</a> to 'Yes', 'Output' or 'Stdout'.

    <p><b>24. SMTPSpamCodes: </b><br>
    <i><b>Parameter: Comma separated list of three-digits SMTP codes</b></i><br>
    <i><b>Default value: None</b></i><br>
    Using this option will instruct Animail to delete from the server
    they were downloaded the messages to which the local SMTP server
    issue an SMTP error code matching one of the codes on this option
    list, insted of leaving the offending message in the server as would
    happen with other error codes. This is usually used to enable the
    local SMTP anti-spam features, thus the option name.

        <h3><a name="33:PostFiltros"></a><b>3.3 &lt;PostFilter&gt;
        options</B></h3>
    </center>

    <p><b>1. PostFilterName:</b><br>
    <I><b>Parameter: String </B></i><br>
    <i><b>Default value: None (must be specified)</b></i><br>
    Name for the filter. It will be using whenever Animail needs to name
    this filter in his output.

    <p><b>2. Path:</b><br>
    <I><b>Parameter: String (file path) </B></i><br>
    <i><b>Default value: None (must be specified)</b></i><br>
    This is the path to the filter program. It must be a file, and that
    file must have permissions to allow Animail reading and executing
    it.

    <p><b>3. InputMessageStdin:</b><br>
    <I><b>Parameter: Boolean (Yes/No) </B></i><br>
    <i><b>Default value: Yes</b></i><br>
    This switch tells Animail is the email must be feed to the
    postfilter program using the program standard input. Since most mail
    filters operate this way, the default value is 'Yes'. If you set
    this option to 'No', read the description of the 'Options' command..

    <p><b>4. Options:</b><br>
    <I><b>Parameter: String (program arguments) </B></i><br>
    <i><b>Default value: None</b></i><br>
    This options set the arguments to be passed to the postfilter
    program. If you set InputStdin to 'No' you probably need to specify
    the path to the mail message to the filter in his options string.
    This is done substituting the flag '%M' in this string by the actual
    path of the mail message. For example, if you are using a filter
    that don't accept mails in his standart input but need that mail to
    be specified after a '-f' switch, this command argument would be:
    <code>Options: -f %M</code>.

    <p><b>5. KillerReturnValues:</b><br>
    <I><b>Parameter: Comma separated list of numbers</B></i><br>
    <i><b>Default value: None</b></i><br>

    This options specifies a comma separated list of numbers (can be a
    single token) being those numbers return values that in case of
    matching (one or more of them) against the filter return value will
    cause the mail to be filtered. You can specify this option and
    the 'KillerProgramOutput' option at the same time.

    <p><b>6. KillerProgramOutput:</b><br>
    <I><b>Parameter: String (regular expression)</B></i><br>
    <i><b>Default value: None</b></i><br>

    This option specifies a regular expression that would be checked
    against the filter program output and in case of match would cause
    the mail to be filtered. You can specify this option and
    the 'KillerReturnValues' option at the same time.

    <p><b>7. ShowFilterOutput:</b><br>
    <I><b>Parameter: Boolean (Yes/No) </B></i><br>
    <i><b>Default value: No</b></i><br>
    This options specifies if the program filter output (stantard output
    and standard error) must be shown. 
    
    <p><b>8. SavePostFilteredMails:</b><br>
    <I><b>Parameter: Boolean or String (Yes/No/Output/Stdout) </B></i><br>
    <i><b>Default value: No</b></i><br>
    This options specifies if the mails filtered by the post-filters
    must be copied to a mbox file ('spambox' file). The possible values
    are: 'Yes' if the original message must be copied to the spambox,
    'No' if don't, 'Output' if the filter program output is what is
    to be copied to the spambox, instead of the original message and
    'Stdout' which does the same that 'Output' but don't include the
    error output (stderr) which will be printed.

    <p>
    If this option is set to 'Yes' or 'Output' you must also give a
    value to the option 'PostFilteredMailsMBox' of the <a
    href="#32:Globales">&lt;global&gt; options</a> section.

    <B>3.1 Binding Animail filtering to a Mutt macro</B> <BR>
     <BR>
     Put this in your .muttrc: <BR>
     <BR>
     macro index X |~/bin/macrospam\n <BR>
     macro pager X |~/bin/macrospam\n <BR>
     <BR>
     Now create a new file called macrospam in ~/bin with the text: <BR>
     <BR>
     #!/bin/bash <BR>
     grep 'From:' $s | grep -v 'Resent'&gt;&gt; ~/.animailfilters <BR>
     <BR>
     and make it executable with: <BR>
     <BR>
     chmod +x ~bin/macrospam <BR>
     <BR>
     Now, pressing X in Mutt will add the currently selected mail to the Animail
    filterfile.
